So... hello. It's been a while, reader. This site is probably up a few days after I create this blog post, and I want to say why it took a while.

First of all, this is built with **Next.js** and React, pretty cool right? I hope so. It is also built with
TailwindCSS with the typography plugin, and that's my main reason why this blog post + this site took a while to reach full completion.

The typography is SO PAINFUL TO CONTROL. Yes, it's meant to be low-level, but why is it so hard to change styles with the current Tailwind version (currently on **2.2.19** at the time of writing this blog post).

I can never get it to work and I don't know if it's Next.js doing stuff under the hood and removing the `prose` element?
