I'm sorry for everything, and I don't think words can describe how sorry I am. I fucked up, yes, but I want to move on from that, with you.
I'm sorry for breaking your trust and doing something so stupid that lead to right now, I really am. I don't know how to make you forgive me,
so this is a goodbye letter...

Thanks for helping with me for everything, I really do appreciate what you did for me, but I don't think you want to see me anymore, so this
is the last thing I will say forever.

Seriously, thanks for everything. You've been the best and I am still so terribly sorry...
