arch linux! It is something to say the least. Recently, I wanted to start a new, refreshed Arch instance on my computer since Manjaro was
getting way too laggy for me and I don't really like it, so I wanted to install it. Thing is, I am a complete fucking dumbass, so when partitioning
(_in which, I do not want to do again_), I deleted Windows because I was in fdisk:

```sh
$ fdisk ...
Command (m for help): g
Created new GPT table!

Command (m for help): w
Written successfully!
```

and I panic'd... I did this without thinking and now I am sad.

I'll probably create a new post on how I am going to design Arch Linux to be like **r/unixporn** (joke), byeeee~
