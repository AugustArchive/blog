this is just a rant post on why the american school system will never work on me.

## 1. starting and ending school times

at my school, we usually start at **8:15 AM** and end at **3:50 PM** (tz: America/Phoenix). getting up at 6am is never a good thing for me since, im not a
morning person, i usually go to bed around **11 PM** and generally sleep around an hour or more, so i never wake up around **6-7AM**, usually around **8-10AM**, which
I like to wake up at. Here in Arizona, or well at my school, I am physically going to school since (during this blog post), this pandemic is slowly going away
for us, but not all over the world.

## 2. workload

Yes, I am in High School, currently in my (hopefully) final year and the workload for me is too much to handle, since teachers here are trying to make education
as fun as possible, but... it never works, well for me.

the workflow gets piled up more and more, but i dont focus on school, i focus on my work here on projects i like to do, because i feel like homework is useless
and is just a way to try to get you to aggregate information you learned today, and that's what it is and it'll never work for me, since i usually forget everything
i know unless i have notes i wrote.

## 3. poor attitude

by poor, i don't mean being a literal asshole, i mean by self-deprecating.

my family doesn't know this (if they see this, hi...), but i am currently suffering from self-deprecation at the moment, though i am still trying to recover.
the reason i am suffering though self-deprecation is comparing myself with others, cliche as it sounds, it happens to the best of us.

like, i dont feel smart and i get really exicited to learn the material if i get it, but tests and exams... they deteroriate my mental health...
i dont like tests or exams because the tests get through my head and i try my hardest, but aggregating information from school for me is
nothing but me forgetting. i get really depressed if i receive a low grade on a quiz/test/exam because i tried my hardest on the assignment, but i just
fail... for what? it seems pointless for me to take a test and just fail the class immediately.
