# Who am I?

im noel. 17 year old developer who likes to do code and theater, pretty unique right! i live in arizona with my family :3, going to highschool,
the perfect teenager dream... right?

no.

## How did you start coding?

i started coding around febuary 2017 (wow, 5 years already?), i learned javascript when i started out using visual studio code, since
i was around the discord bot/api community, and i wanted to create my own bot! so i did.

fast forward 5 years, i am probably going to create a company. pretty sweet huh? probably, i dont know.

## Why do you write in lowercase in everything you write?

because i want you to know that i am always dead inside.

Just playing, it's because doing everything right is bad. I want to do it my own way, since this is _my_ blog, so i'll write how i like, thanks.

## Why did you write a blog?

because, i wanted to play a joke i had in my head. most developers have blogs, right? what do they have in common?

they don't consistely pump out blog posts.

yea, im calling 95% of every developer out there. the only ones i seen being consistent is a person i know from a community, [Palaiologos](https://github.com/kspalaiologos).
been loving what she writes, and i think that's pretty neat. i could do that, but let's be honest. if we want to be known for our work,
we have to repeat everything everyone does! (i could be joking, i dont know.)

also, you could say i was inspired to write one. i did this as a joke + to jot down some feelings, i been loving [amy's blog](https://b.amy.gg), the topics
she writes is pretty interesting and i love her work, wish i can be that smart, who knows?
